        answer:"There is no legal restriction on foreigners to open (individual) bank account in Kenya. Yet, banks will ask for the purpose of the account, and why an account is required in Kenya. It is relatively easier for a Kenyan limited company (owned by foreigner) to open a bank account in Kenya. The banks will ask for the business background of the owner, planned activities of the limited company, and business proof of existing company (overseas company) operated by the same owner."
